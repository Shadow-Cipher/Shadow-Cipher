👋 Hi, I’m @Shadow-Cipher

👀 I’m interested in pursuing truth and learning as much as possible before I die. I am basically a lifelong student. I read a lot of non-fiction books. I first began programming around 2000 and can write code fluently in AutoLISP, Visual Basic 6.0, and am very familiar with HTML, JavaScript, VB.NET, C#, and have done contract work for all of those languages.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github, C/C++, Visual Basic .NET, PowerShell, Linux, Networking, Server Administration, JavaScript, and many other things.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the things mentioned above that I'm learning, and possibly other things as well.

📫 How to reach me is complicated. I recently jacked up my MX settings for one of my domains and have yet to fix it. As a matter of fact, I only recently got back into my github account because I had to contact them due to the fact that my recovery e-mail account isn't currently receiving email and hasn't been for about a month now. Eventually I will fix this, I just haven't had the time to do that yet.
